//TODO//
1. Make the player be able to interact with the simulation. (spawn things, kill creatures, etc)
2. Have the creatures lay eggs that hatch instead of instantly spawning another creature.
3. The predators need some way of increasing their strength and speed, and some way of multiplying.

//IDEAS//
1. Have there not be any predators at first, but have there be a chance for the newly born prey to be a predator?

//BUGS//
1. None so far!
