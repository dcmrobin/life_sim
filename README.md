# life_sim
There are predators and prey.

//TODO//
1. Make the player be able to interact with the simulation. (spawn things, kill creatures, etc)
2. Have the creatures lay eggs that hatch instead of instantly spawning another creature.

//IDEAS//
1. Have there not be any predators at first, but have there be a chance for the newly born prey to be a predator?

//BUGS//
1. None so far!
