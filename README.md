There are predators and prey.

The predator's one goal is to eat prey to add an amount of time to its ever-decreasing lifetime, and the prey's one goal is to make more of itself.

Mutations can happen.

Predators can eat each other when their strengths are equal and they're both chasing a prey, but otherwise will let the predator with the highest strength get the kill.

Predators will surround the prey if another predator is near to prevent it from escaping.
